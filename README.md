# Auth-App-With-PHP
<p>It's a simple app that allows for user login and registration. They are then redirected to a basic profile page where they have the option 
to change their personal information. The app uses prepared PDO statements to insert and update users into MySQL. There's also effective error handling implemented with messages
to the user.
</p>

<h1>To start the app..</h1>
<p>The app is based on the XAMPP local server, so you will need to install it. </p>
<p>After that:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>Run the Apache and MySQL servers in the XAMPP utility tool</li>
  <li>Place the app files in the folder htdocs (your_xampp_install_dir/xampp/htdocs)</li>
  <li>Open the browser and go to localhost</li>
  <li>In the apps list choose - App-Auth-With-PHP</li>
</ol>

<p>For manual database manipulation, you have to go and open the admin dashboard at localhost/phpmyadmin</p>
